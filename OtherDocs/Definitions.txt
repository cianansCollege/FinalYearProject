MFCC = Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
    Mel-Frequency → the frequency scale is adapted to how humans perceive sound (we hear low frequencies more accurately than high ones).
    Cepstral → a way of representing the spectrum of a signal (how energy is distributed across frequencies).
    Coefficients → numbers that summarize important features of the audio signal.
    In short: MFCCs summarize the important spectral characteristics of a sound in a compact form
    Why MFCCs are useful:
        Humans perceive sound non-linearly; MFCCs approximate this perception.
        They are widely used in speech recognition, speaker identification, and accent analysis.
        Instead of using raw audio (millions of samples), MFCCs give a small set of numbers per short window of audio that still captures the timbre and characteristics of speech.
    How MFCCs are computed (conceptually):
        Split audio into short frames (20–40 ms)
        Speech changes quickly, so we analyze small slices.
        Compute the Fourier Transform of each frame
        This gives the spectrum (frequencies present in that slice).
        Map frequencies to the Mel scale
        Low frequencies are more finely resolved; high frequencies are compressed.
        Take the logarithm of the Mel spectrum
        Human hearing is roughly logarithmic in loudness.
        Apply the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
        Compresses the information into a small number of coefficients (typically 12–13 MFCCs per frame).
    Output:
        For a 1-second audio clip at 16 kHz, you might get a matrix of size 13 × N, where:
        13 → number of MFCCs (rows)
        N → number of frames/windows (columns)
        Each column is like a “snapshot” of the spectral characteristics at that moment.
    How they’re used in ML
        You can treat each column as a feature vector for that short time window.
        Common applications:
        Speech recognition → predict phonemes or words
        Speaker ID → identify who is speaking
        Accent / language classification → detect regional accents or languages

itertuples() returns an iterator over the rows of a Pandas DataFrame.
    eg.
        import pandas as pd
        
        df = pd.DataFrame({
            "first_name": ["Alice", "Bob"],
            "last_name": ["Smith", "Jones"],
            "age": [25, 30]
        })

        # Using itertuples
        for row in df.itertuples():
            print(row)

        output:
            Pandas(Index=0, first_name='Alice', last_name='Smith', age=25)
            Pandas(Index=1, first_name='Bob', last_name='Jones', age=30)
