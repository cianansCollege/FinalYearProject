used build_dataset.py to join the three tables. 

created final_dataset_all.csv (which includes all data) and final_dataset_model.csv (keeps only TDs, must have constituency and province).

 The final modelling dataset was cleaned to remove artefactual columns introduced by spreadsheet software and to ensure a consistent and well-defined schema prior to feature extraction.

 I am currently deciding what way to split my data for training.
 Currently:
Speakers per province:
    Leinster    90
    Munster     38
    Connacht    18
    Ulster      11

current plan:
    Method: Stratified Group K-Fold
        k: 5
        Groups: speaker_key
        Labels: province

    Report:
        Mean accuracy
        Std deviation across folds
        Confusion matrix (aggregated)

Going to try and balance out data by adding speakers from each constituency in northern ireland first.
