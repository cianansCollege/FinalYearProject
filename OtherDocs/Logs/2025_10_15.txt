This is my first time truly working on my FYP. I am a bit nervous but I think it should be very interesting so I am excited.

I want to start by finding and storing some speech data that I may be able to use.

Potential open source data sets:
    Mozilla Common Voice
    VoxForge
    Tatoeba Audio
    Librispeech
