I was working on it for the last week. 
mostly I have been creating metadata manually for the Speakers from my data set.
I have now created a csv with the following tables:
    dail_speaker_files [filename, speaker_raw, speaker_key]

    SpeakerMaster[speaker_key, native_place, native_city, native_county, constituency, party, non_td_role, extra_information, gender]

    constituency_coordinates[constituencies, coordinates]

I had to write a python program to extract the speaker name from the file names ie. 
"U1FlGieXtF8_Deputy Aengus √ì Snodaigh - Government Business - 0.wav" to "Deputy Aengus √ì Snodaigh" to "aengus o snodaigh"

Then I got all unique speakers into speaker_master. i cleaned it so if there was any duplication through small spelling differences and such.
Then I manually got the rest of the information on them.
Then I cleaned the data ensuring modern constituency names and such.
I standardised all data, removing fádas temporarliy and ensuring correct spelling and styling.

Now I am creating coordinatesfor the constituencies:
    using https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/constituencies/ to get centroid.
