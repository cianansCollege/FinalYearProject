Due to errors last day of bulk downloading data, I will be just making a small prototype with the small data set that I found online of 196
from the Dáil. 

Downloaded soundfile to begin sound analysis.

Output of Prototype_CheckClips.py:
    samplerate: 16000 Hz
    channels: 1
    duration: 5.878 s
    format: WAV (Microsoft) [WAV]
    subtype: Signed 16 bit PCM [PCM_16]

Ran into problem with sklearn- needed to use scikit-learn.
Ran into problem with librosa, my python is to new.
