The constituencies are done, and now I am doing a final clean of the file_names to speaker_key to ensure all keys are correct.

thats done

Now its time to join all the tables back together
Going to write these.

I have 2 concerns:
    -40 of the 200 speakers dont have a constiuency as they are not TDs, therefore that cant be their Geographic location. 
        Two solutions, either drop them or use place of birth instead.

    -Data is too scarce to do specifics yet. Have to use provinces instead. 

    -Some TDS were born elsewhere and moved into their constituency.

    We could drop all non tds, forget place of birth and then metadata creation would be much faster. 
    Or we could just use place of birth.
    We also dont have northern ireland
