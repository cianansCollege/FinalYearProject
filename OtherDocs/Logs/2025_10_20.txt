I have been debating changing my project to be to American English as the limitation of data in regards to regional data 
hindering my project greatly.
I have found a git-project called : https://github.com/DanielGall500/dail-eireann-audio-dataset which claims to have
5 clips each from 29 constituents within the dail, seaking about a variety of topics. I will analyse it now.
It shows promise but each clip is quite small.

Could be interesting. Maybe the Dáil is the way to go.

This is a massive reource. It has a diverse range of accents nad information about the people speaking is easy to come by.

I am downloading yt-dlp now:
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg

How to use:
    for audio download:
        yt-dlp -f bestaudio -o "dail_session.mp3" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdef12345

    for video download:
        yt-dlp -f bestvideo+bestaudio -o "dail_session.mp4" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdef12345

Use ffmpeg to get snippets without re-encoding:
    ffmpeg -ss 00:10:45 -to 00:11:15 -i dail_session.mp3 -acodec copy "dublin_td_clip1.mp3"

Convert to same type:
    ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ac 1 -ar 16000 output.wav

Not so much a resource, but very quirky. Roblox Oireachtas?:

Far Right Irish:
    Although speaking nonsense, the sheer amount of yapping may make it a vaiable resource.
